## Bio
  *Pharmacist looking for a career change* <br>
  
I have a *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry* from **North Carolina State University** and a *Doctor of Pharmacy degree* from the **University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill**.  For about the last 10 years I have been a clinical pharmacist and recently have decided I wanted to try something new. I decided to enroll in **Duke's** *Master of Quantitative Management: Health Analytics* program and am taking the Data Science for Statisticians class at NC State. I am particularly interested in how data science can improve health outcome while lowering the cost of healthcare.


### More Information
For hobbies, I enjoy hiking, scuba diving, and swimming.  <br>
