What do you think being a data scientist is about? 
I think being a data scientist is about knowing which questions to ask, collecting, organizing, and analyzing the data to find a solution, and then communicating the solution to a target audience.  


What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? 
As I understand the field of data science it is a combination of several skill sets. Data scientists need to have a strong math/ statistics background, programming skills, and business/ domain knowledge as well as a natural curiosity to explore problems. I think the major goal of a data scientists are to be able to get valuable information out of a mass amount of data. 
I am particularly interested how data science can impact the healthcare field. I have been a pharmacist for about the last ten years. I think data science is one of the keys to our current healthcare crisis. Healthcare is a very complex subject but if we are able to use data science to make more accurate diagnosis, and delivery more effective and efficient treatments, we’re headed in the right direction. 


What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  
I think there is a lot of overlap between data science and statistics. Both fields have the goal of extracting knowledge from data. I see the statisticians are the ones who plan the data collection and analysis and the data scientist as the one who extracts the insights from the data collected. Data scientists need to have a strong statistical background, and so a lot of them are also statisticians. I would say the main difference, as I understand it, between the two fields is that data scientists need to know more about the business that they are working in than a statistician would. So, for example, a data scientist in the pharmaceutical industry needs to understand the drug development and clinical trial process. Whereas a biostatistician in the pharmaceutical industry needs to understand the statistics involved in drug development and clinical trials but not necessarily things such as the structure activity relationships in drug development or patient recruitment in clinical trials. 


How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
I see myself on the more the data analytics/ data scientist side of things. I have a PharmD and am looking for a career change, but still want to be able to use my pharmacy degree. I am in the master’s program at Duke for health analytics and am hoping to either work in the pharmaceutical industry or in a hospital using data to improve health outcomes and lower costs.
