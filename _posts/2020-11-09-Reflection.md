## Reflection Blog Post

I think this course has helped me better see the difficulties of dealing with large amounts of data and some of the struggles of data science. 
My opinion of data science has not changed too much since the beginning of the class, but I feel like I have a clearer idea of what data science 
actually is and isn’t. In this class we dealt with mostly clean data so that we could learn how to use R. I think in the real world, clean data is 
anomaly rather than the norm. I’ve done some projects in other classes and have had to clean the data. I can say this class has helped me 
tremendously in doing that. 

I really enjoyed learning the R language and plan to use it going forward. I haven’t figured out exactly what I want to do for a career yet but 
hopefully will be able to integrate some of the thing I have learned in this class. I feel like R is a relatively easy language to learn and has
a lot of potential. I hope to get a little better at it, but I guess that come with practice.

I’ve had some exposure to programming languages but not much. I took the intro to SAS class as a prerequisite for this class and have seen some 
python and R in my Duke classes. I don’t know if I really do anything different now that I have taken this course. I’m still in school and trying
to figure out what to do for a career. I think this class gave me a little bit of confidence as far as I am capable of learning the language 
and could probably get decent at it with some practice.
