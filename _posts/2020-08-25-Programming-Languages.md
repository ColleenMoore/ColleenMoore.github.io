## My Opinion of R vs. SAS
I have had very limited experience programming but am trying to learn R and python. I took the SAS class as a prerequisite for this class. In addition, I have learned a little python as well as some R in my Health Analytics masters. 


For what I know of R so far, it seems to be a reality easy language to learn. I began to learn R on DataCamp, which walks you through learning it. DataCamp provides a very gentle introduction to using R. When I took the SAS class at State, that was my very first experience programming and I had a difficult time. Iâ€™m not sure if SAS is more difficult to learn as compared to R, or if it was just the fact that when I took the SAS class, I had no experience programming at all. I think no matter what software you choose to learn first; it is always the hardest. 


The thing I like about R the most is that there are so many resources if you have a question. If I have a question as to how to do something in R, I can google it and most of the time find an answer. The help function in R is always very useful. I also like being able to easily output PDF or word files. One thing I liked about SAS was that it was not case sensitive like R is.
